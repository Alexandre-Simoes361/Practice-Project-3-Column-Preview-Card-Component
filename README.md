## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was a relatively simple project, and I wouldn't say I learned anything new per se, it's more that I used the opportunity to hone my existing skills further, for example by trying to write the simplest and most efficient CSS I could, which required some thought and mental planning to know which classes to create and which classes not to create, and how to create the widest rules possible without sacrificing control. I did, however, try to use relative measures instead of absolute measures for the first time to take responsiveness into account, as I feel it's a good habit to get into.

### Continued development

I wish to continue to develop every skill I have learned so far, but more directly I want to gain a bigger mastery over relative units like em and rem. I also wish to continue to focus on simplifying my code as much as possible.
